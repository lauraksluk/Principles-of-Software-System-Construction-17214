The instructions can be found in `README.md` in the `main` branch. 

## Note on Travis/Checkstyle

You might notice that the Travis build fails right now, due to a checkstyle error. This is due to the `// TODO` comment in `Main.java`; it will succeed when that comment is removed. You will probably see builds fail quite a bit more often during this course, as you push your own code. Keep an eye on this; it is often a helpful signal that something is broken or imperfect, so learning to read the logs to figure out why it failed is a helpful skill. Naturally, the build should not fail when you turn in your assignments.
