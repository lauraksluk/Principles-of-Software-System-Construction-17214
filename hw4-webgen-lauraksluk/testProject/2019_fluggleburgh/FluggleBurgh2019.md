## Nov 1-3, Pittsburgh, PA

[Facebook Event](https://www.facebook.com/events/1437911102999501/)

### About

**FluggleBurgh** is a 3-day festival for all circus and skill arts hosted by Pittsburghs juggling, acro, and flow arts community (fluggle = flow + juggle). It will be held at the Winchester Thurston School in the heart of Pittsbugh. FluggleBurgh will provide a communal practice space with tall ceilings, classrooms with scheduled workshops all weekend, outdoor practice and fire space (weather permitting), object manipulation games/competition, and shows. All activities will be in the same space. All walks of object manipulation, circus arts, and movement arts are welcome.

In spirit, it is a successor of the [Not Quite Pittsburgh Juggling Festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_janE-erfKc) (2008-2015). Now, the festival is actually within the Pittsburgh city limits.

Our big goal of this festival is to bring the various communities around circus arts and other skills from Pittsburgh and beyond together, share workshops, and showcase the various skills in a show. We expect plenty of juggling, acrobatics, and flow workshops, as well as some clowning, balloons, and maybe even magic and unicycling.

### Program (subject to change)

**Gym times (open practice, workshops)**
Friday Nov 1, 2019, 5pm-11pm
Saturday Nov 2, 2019, 10am-11pm (gym closes during show)
Sunday Nov 3, 2019, 10am-3pm

We ask for $5 per day for all activities in the gym to help offset the cost of the festival (rent, insurance, ...). Winchester Thurston students and their families can join for free, so do CMU students. We offer a discounted $20 weekend package that includes all three days in the gym and a ticket for the main show.

**Fire Jam (Friday Nov 1, 8pm, free)**
The fire jam is informal and will be outside on the school's grounds, weather permitting. It will be canceled or moved in case of heavy rain.

**FluggleBurgh Gala Show (Saturday Nov 2, 7pm-9pm, Winchester Thurston -- Auditorium)**
FluggleBurgh Gala Show (10\$, cash only or buy [online](https://carnegiemellontickets.universitytickets.com/w/event.aspx?id=1948&p=1) in advance, free for CMU students): The Gala show on Saturday will be at Winchester Thurston as well. It will feature various circus acts, including juggling, flow, and acro. As usual [Oâ€™Ryan McGowan-Arrowroot](http://www.oryanarrowroot.com/about) will guide through the show.
Show tickets can be bought in the gym during the festival, or at the door for $10 (cash only). Doors open about 30 min before the show.

**FluggleBurgh Renegade Show (Saturday Nov 2, 11pm, [Stack'd Shadyside](https://www.stackdburgers.com/shadyside), hosted by Dr. Boogie)**
Join us for a late night informal renegade show over a beer or a burger after the gym closes. Not suited for children. At 5741 Ellsworth Ave, about a 10 min walk from the gym. Bring short acts that are (at least) 2 of 3 things: Short. Funny. Awesome.

**FluggleBurgh Games (Sunday Nov 3, 1pm, Winchester Thurston -- gym)**
A mix of old and new games, watch or compete, open for all.

### Where

With the exception of the Renegade show, all activities (gym, workshops, shows) will be at **Winchester Thurston School:** [555 Morewood Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Winchester+Thurston+School/@40.4462609,-79.9293499,14.92z/data=!4m16!1m7!2m6!1shotels!5m4!5m2!1s2017-11-10!2i2!9i120!3m7!1s0x8834f23d7a2e9e55:0x549b754f124d6701!5m2!1s2017-11-10!2i2!8m2!3d40.4515467!4d-79.9420045)

Parking is available on school grounds. The festival is in the school's gym and can be accessed from the parking lot (next to the soccer field). The school is in the heart of Pittsburgh's Shadyside neighborhood and close to numerous bus stops (including 28X, P1, 71A-D, 75). There are many restaurants nearby, many of them in nearby Walnut Street. There are numerous hotels nearby; for more budget-friendly places to stay look at AirBnB or look for hotels in the outskirts of town toward Monroeville or toward the airport. The site is only a short walk from CMU, Pitt and Chatham University.
