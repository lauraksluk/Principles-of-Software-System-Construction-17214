### About

**FluggleBurgh** is a 3-day festival for all circus and skill arts hosted by Pittsburghs juggling, acro, and flow arts community (fluggle = flow + juggle). It will be held at the [Community Forge Space](http://www.forge.community/), a former school, in Wilkinsburg PA, just outside of Pittsburgh. FluggleBurgh will provides a communal practice space with tall ceilings, numerous classrooms with scheduled workshops all weekend, outdoor practice and fire space (weather permitting), object manipulation games/competition, and two shows. All walks of object manipulation and movement arts are welcome.

In spirit, it is a successor of the [Not Quite Pittsburgh Juggling Festival](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_janE-erfKc) (2008-2015).

Our big goal of this festival is to bring the various communities around circus arts and other skills from Pittsburgh and beyond together, share workshops, and showcase the various skills in a show. We expect plenty of juggling, acrobatics, aerial, and flow workshops, as well as some clowning, balloons, and maybe even magic and pogo.
