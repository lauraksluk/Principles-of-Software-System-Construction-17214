# Welcome to the CMU Juggling Club

Official website: https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/juggle/



We are the juggling club of the **Carnegie Mellon University** in **Pittsburgh**, open to students and non-students. Whether you already know how to juggle or want to learn, just come and join us and have some fun.



### Juggle With Us!

We meet twice a week on the CMU campus:

- **Sunday afternoons**, Schenley Plaza or Newell-Simon Hall Atrium
- **Wednesdays afternoon**, Outside on the Cut

See mailing list for short term announcements, location changes, extra dates, or cancelations. During warm weather, meetings are usually outside on the cut or on Schenley Plaza. If you’re driving, parking on campus is free after 5 PM on weekdays in most places (including the East Campus Garage) as well as all day Sunday.

### About Us

The Masters of Flying Objects is a juggling club at Carnegie Mellon University. It is open to all members of the Carnegie Mellon community as well as anyone in the greater Pittsburgh area. We welcome people of all levels of ability, and we are happy to teach people with no prior juggling experience.

We meet frequently, usually twice a week during the school year. Check the mailing list and info above to find our next meeting date and location. If you have any questions about the club, don’t hesitate to contact us — preferably over the mailing list, on Facebook.

The purpose of *Masters of Flying Objects* is to provide and foster an environment for those interested in the art of juggling in which they can meet, share and develop talents, teach skills, and share equipment. The club will promote and teach the art of juggling, contribute to the available recreational activities on campus, represent Carnegie Mellon University in the greater juggling community, and provide juggling-related opportunities to the campus and local community.
