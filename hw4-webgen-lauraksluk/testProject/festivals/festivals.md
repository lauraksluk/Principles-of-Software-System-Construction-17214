# Juggling Festivals

Many countries, cities or [juggling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juggling) clubs hold their own annual **juggling convention** or **juggling festivals**. These are the backbone of the [juggling scene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_juggling_culture), the events that regularly bring jugglers from a wide area together to socialize. The attendance of a convention can be anything from a few dozen to a few thousand people.

In Pittsburgh itself, the CMU juggling club has been hosting FluggleBurgh. Around Pittsburgh main festivals are at RIT in Rochester, in Cleveland, in Philadelphia, and in Lehigh Valley (Poconos Festival). Several others might be worth flying to.
