# Experience Report

The quality of technical support from the framework-providing team, Team Deadline Fighters, was helpful.
Their reply times for support in answering GitHub Issues, were quick.
This was extremely helpful as we could post an explanation of our problem, attached with a possible
screenshot of the issue, and obtain an answer back within 10-15 minutes.


In the beginning of this project, there were issues regarding setting up the
environment. Some `mvn` and `npm` commands that were supposed to start running the project,
did not work properly. But, the Deadline Fighters team were quick to respond
with possible solutions. Although they failed to mention that the backend
and frontend should be running simultaneously, eventually, they assisted in solving the issue.

When we were testing our newly added data plugin implementations, we discovered a varying display result
of running the program. For a specific scenario where multiple plugins of the same type were used, a team member with a Windows machine was able to successfully
run the program to completion. But, the other team members using a Mac computer ran into an IOException. This resulted
in us asking the framework-providing team for assistance via GitHub issues. Again, their replies
were very fast. They informed us that the expected functionality was that the program successfully runs, with no exceptions.
But, they also stated that they believe they found a bug in their framework implementation of reusing the
same data plugin instance. Implementations of different data plugins should still run correctly.

The framework-providing team is very transparent with their possible issues, and very helpful
with providing a multitude of suggested solutions. Their timely and prompt replies are appreciated.
